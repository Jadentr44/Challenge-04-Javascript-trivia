## How to Use

When the page loads, there will be a button to start the game, once you click it you will have 30 seconds to correclty answer 5 javascript syntax questions. Once the time runs out, our you answer all of the questions you will be given the option to submit your initals, and play again.

## Algorithms

#### Displaying the next question
1. it will check if there are any more questions to display, if not it will stop the game
2. a random question will be pulled, and all of the current buttons will be deleted
3. it will loop through the question options and create a button for each, displaying the option, and storing the option in the element
